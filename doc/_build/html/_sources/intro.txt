Introduction to ODM  
*********************

|ODM| is

* a central place for finding run-related information
* a place for searching and retrieving desired list of runs or automatically generated figures
* a place for prompt analysis in order to quickly identify existing or potential problems
* technically, a convenient front end of various databases and flat files


|ODM| is not

* a replacement of online monitors 
* a replacement of detailed offline analysis

 
`Dive Into ODM <http://dayabay.ihep.ac.cn/cgi-bin/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=5517>`_ is a good introduction to the basic philosophy and implementation behind |ODM|. 

Beginner web developers should start from the :doc:`Get Started <getstarted>`  Chapter. Experienced developers can go directly to the API Documentations.
