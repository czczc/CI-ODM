Main Style
-----------

:file:`styels/main.css`

:file:`styles/zone.css`

:file:`styles/form.css`


The ODM main style is customized from 
`CodeIgniter Doc Style <http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/doc_style>`_ for its clearness. In addition, to have a consistent style across the whole site, ODM follows the following rule: 

* The main content is wrapped in ``<div id="content"></div>``
* Each subject is wrapped in ``<div class="subject"></div>``
* Subject title uses ``<h2></h2>`` heading
* Inline heading uses ``<h6></h6>``
 

JQuery UI
----------

:file:`styles/cupertino/`

ODM adopts the *cupertino* theme for its ease to the eyes. However this can be easily changed by downloading customized themes from 
`JQuery UI Theme Roler <http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/>`_. We do prefer a theme that matches the rest of the site.
